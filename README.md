# Mescio Hire Frontend Test

## Test Instructions
Fork this repository, commit and push the project you have created and let us know your github username


## Frontend Requirements

## Application Requirements:
Create a static web application that is able to explore the candidates data set. The application should list all candidates that have a match and are not deleted.
More than that the application, will have to sort descending the candidates based on the match percentage.
If the candidate is deleted, this should be known to the user however you decide.

Sample representation:

```
| Matched Candidates    | Search: ________________          |
|                       |                                   |
| Active: (13)          | Name: {FirstName} {LastName}      |
| Deleted: (10)         | Percentage: 50.00%                |
|                       | Matched: {MatchDate}              |
```
